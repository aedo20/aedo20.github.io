                I am currently a photojournalism student at the University of Florida. I have been taking pictures for five years and am a freelance photographer. I have written articles throughout my college career about events and issues in Gainesville around the University of Florida. One of my favorite articles was published in the Gainesville Sun. The article was about bicycle sculptures made by local artists in Gainesville, where my photo was also included in the article. I also have a complete photo story on the couple and why they decided to make these pieces. I have worked on several multimedia projects and photo storys, which you can find on my blog that is linked to my website. My blog is aimed toward upcoming photojournalists, but if you are interested in learning the technical parts of a camera, you can also learn it on my blog. Any photographer in general can learn from my blog. If you like some of my work go ahead and contact me with the following information below.
